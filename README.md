# Mouse_interface

First tried to look at mousedata from windows

Then hijacked a mouse sensor (FCT) based on this [Github](https://github.com/VineetSukhthanker/FCT3065-XY_MouseSensor.git) by Vineet Sukhthanker in order to interface with it more directly using an Arduino Nano and a level converter.

The goal is to use this sensor for slip detection.
